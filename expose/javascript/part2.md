1. It will print the number of objects that have price which is 3
2. Print 150, the discountedprice of final value in the array, 300 * 0.5 = 150
3. It will just print 150, the final price after all the calculation of discount price for last value in the array.
4. It does not return anything because the return function would not return anything
5. It will give a i is not defined error becuase let only is defined within the block
6. Also notdefinederror as let only defined in blocks
7. It will print 150 because let finalprice is defined within the large block
8. Not return anything as it is returning empty
9. i is not defined as it is let
10. It will print 3 as the length of price array is 3
11. It won't return anything as empty array
12. A. student.name 
    B. student['Grad year'] 
    C. student.greeting() 
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name 
    E. student.courseload[0]
13. A. '32' '3' + 2 is string + integer and maps to 32
    B. 1 because '3' - 2 is 3 - 2 which is 1.
    C. 3 because null is just 0
    D. '3null' as string 3 maps onto null
    E. 4 because true is 1 and 1 + 3 = 4
    F. 0 because false is 0 and null is 0
    G. '3undefined' as string maps onto undefined
    H.  NaN as subtracting is always treated the same regardless
14. A. True as string always greater than integer
    B. False as string object incomparable
    C. true string is treated as number and same in ==
    D. false as string now it compares type and value and is false
    E. false because true evaluates to 1 and not same as 2
    F. true because type and value of boolean(2) is both true and 1
15. double equals operator convert types if they are not the same type, triple equals compares types and values when interpreting.
17. It would return the array of [2,4,6] because after modifyArray is called, you would try to get array and callback which is dosomething, and that would have each value in array multiply its value by 2. Therfore, [1,2,3] would become [2,4,6].
19. 1 4 3 2
